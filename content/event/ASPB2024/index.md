summary: A progress report on our comparative genomics 
abstract: 'Recent advances in genomic sequencing technologies have resulted in numerous high-quality genomes for model plant species, however, such data remains scarce for non-model plant species such as agricultural weeds. To rectify this limitation, the International Weed Genomics Consortium (IWGC) was established in 2021 to sequence, assemble, annotate, and publish reference-quality genomes for the most economically important weed species1. Here we present a chromosome-level genome for the cosmopolitan allohexaploid (BCD subgenomes) weed, *Chenopodium album* L., produced by the IWGC. We hypothesize weeds contain genomic patterns associated with their adaptive capabilities which are not found in their non-weed relatives. To investigate, we compared homologous regions, cytochrome P450 content, and selection pressures in terms of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous protein-coding nucleotide substitutions (dN/dS) between the IWGC *C. album* genome from the United States, a public *C. album* genome from the United Kingdom, and *C. formosanum* (djulis; BCD subgenomes), a theorized domesticated form of *C. album*. We found selection patterns across genes associated with adaptation in plants. We also provide a pipeline which we hope will make the analysis and visualization of dN/dS values faster and more accessible, especially for non-computational scientists.'
