        As a graduate research assistant in Dr. Eric Patterson's lab at Michigan State University, I utilize a range of computational approaches for comparative genomics of weedy and non-           weedy plant genomes to understand the adaptive capabilities of weeds. For this work I have performed analyses such as phyologeny, dN/dS, genome annotation, alignment, differential expression, enrichment, and a variety of visualization methods.

        I enjoy producing computational tools from my work with the aim of making computational analysis more approachable for non-computational biologists.
