        As a graduate research assistant in Dr. Eric Patterson's lab at Michigan State University, I utilize a range of computational approaches for comparative genomics of weedy and non-           weedy plant genomes to understand the adaptive capabilities of weeds.

        In the first chapter of my dissertation, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated chromosome-level genomes for a glyphosate-resistant individual and a glyphosate-susceptible individual of *Eleusine indica* (goosegrass), a significant weed of rice, cotton, and turf. We also re-sequenced and generated RNA-seq for eight individuals of each population to observe structural variation surrounding the gene *5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase* (*EPSPS*), which produces the target protein of glyphosate. We found that in glyphosate-resistant goosegrass, the ~40Kbp surrounding *EPSPS* and a ~30Kbp region located ~1Mbp away from the native location of *EPSPS* are transclocated from their native locations on chromosome three to the subtelomere of chromosome three where they are fused into a 100Kbp unit and subsequently duplicated. We believe this unique structural variation results in *EPSPS* being duplicated ~25 times and overexpressed in all glyphosate-resistant indivuals and none of the glyphosate-susceptible individuals. We published this work in *Nature Communications* in August 2023, just in time for my comprehensive exam üòÅ

        I am currently conducting comparative genomics analyses to observe structural variation within the *Chenopodium* genus. There are several crop, weed, and wild plants within this genus with publicly available genomic resources, including a chromosome-level genome our group (the International Weed Genomics Consortium) produced for this project. 

        Additionally, I enjoy producing computational tools from my work with the aim of making computational analysis more approachable for non-computational biologists.
